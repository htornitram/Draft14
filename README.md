Draft14
=======

Quick C#/MVC application to manage a fantasy baseball draft.

Uses a specific, rather esoteric set of rules for one particular league which was drafting in the near future, rather than being more generic. (Note the word "quick" in the description above.) One particularly odd rule was "no internet connections during the draft", so the whole thing had to run locally.

There's some stuff in here that quite accurately appears to have been thrown together at the last minute, but it worked. (Again, "quick". Pretty much anything goes the day before the draft.)

Perhaps more and better to come next Spring Training...
